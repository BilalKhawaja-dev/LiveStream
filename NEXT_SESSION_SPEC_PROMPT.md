## üéØ **Session Prompt for Kiro:**

*"I need to build out the core application functionality for my streaming platform. The infrastructure is deployed and frontend authentication is working, but I need to implement the business logic in the Lambda functions, design the database schema, and connect everything together. 

Focus on building a production-ready backend that handles user management, live streaming, content management, payments, and analytics. The goal is to have a fully functional MVP where users can register, subscribe to tiers, creators can stream content, and admins can manage the platform.

Start with the database schema and authentication APIs, then move to streaming functionality and payment integration. Make sure everything is secure, scalable, and well-tested."*
