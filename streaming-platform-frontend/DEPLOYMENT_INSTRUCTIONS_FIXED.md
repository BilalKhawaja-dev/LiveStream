# Frontend Deployment Fix - WORKING SOLUTION

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

We successfully identified and fixed the frontend deployment issue. The applications were showing blank white pages because of **incorrect Vite base path configuration**.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

1. **Issue**: JavaScript assets returning 404 errors
2. **Cause**: Vite configs had `base: '/app-name/'` but nginx serves from root `/`
3. **Result**: HTML loaded but JavaScript files couldn't be found → blank white pages

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Vite Configuration
Changed all Vite configs from:
```typescript
base: '/viewer-portal/'  // ❌ Wrong
```
To:
```typescript
base: '/'  // ✅ Correct
```

### 2. Validated Locally
- Created simple test app → ✅ Works
- Built Docker container → ✅ Works  
- Tested assets loading → ✅ Works
- Applied fix to viewer-portal → ✅ Works

### 3. Deployed Working Version
- Built new viewer-portal image → ✅ Success
- Pushed to ECR → ✅ Success
- Updated ECS service → ✅ In Progress

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Identified root cause (Vite base path)
- [x] Created working test application
- [x] Fixed viewer-portal Vite config
- [x] Built and pushed working image to ECR
- [x] Triggered ECS service update

### 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] ECS service pulling new image
- [ ] Verify live application works

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Wait for ECS deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Test live application**: http://stream-dev-fe-alb-1307843566.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
3. **If working, fix remaining apps**:
   - creator-dashboard
   - admin-portal  
   - analytics-dashboard
   - support-system
   - developer-console

## 🔧 Commands to Fix Remaining Apps

```bash
# Fix all Vite configs (already done for viewer-portal)
cd streaming-platform-frontend

# Update remaining apps
for app in creator-dashboard admin-portal analytics-dashboard support-system developer-console; do
  sed -i "s|base: '/$app/'|base: '/'|g" packages/$app/vite.config.ts
done

# Build and push all apps
./build-and-push-fixed-v2.sh

# Force update all ECS services
./force-update-ecs-services.sh
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After the fix, applications should show:
- ✅ React Application Loading
- ✅ JavaScript Bundle Working  
- ✅ CSS Styles Applied
- ✅ Assets Serving Correctly
- ✅ Docker Container Healthy

Instead of blank white pages.
