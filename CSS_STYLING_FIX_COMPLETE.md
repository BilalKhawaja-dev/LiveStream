# 🎨 CSS Styling Fix - COMPLETE

## ✅ Status: SUCCESS

Successfully fixed the CSS styling issues for the three services that were not displaying proper themes.

## 🔧 Problem Identified

The issue was that **admin-portal**, **analytics-dashboard**, and **developer-console** were missing CSS imports in their `App.tsx` files, while the other services (creator-dashboard, support-system, viewer-portal) already had proper CSS imports.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Missing CSS Imports**
- **admin-portal**: Added `import './styles/admin-theme.css';`
- **analytics-dashboard**: Added `import './styles/analytics-theme.css';`  
- **developer-console**: Added `import './styles/developer-theme.css';`

### 2. **Verified CSS Generation**
All three services now generate CSS files during build:
- ✅ **admin-portal**: 1 CSS file + 1 JS file
- ✅ **analytics-dashboard**: 1 CSS file + 1 JS file
