## 🔍 Current Service Status

```
Service                    | Running | Desired | Status
---------------------------|---------|---------|--------
stream-dev-admin-portal    |    1    |    1    |   ✅

```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **ALB Response Delay**: Services may take 2-3 minutes to respond through ALB due to:
   - Health check grace period
   - Service startup time
   - Target registration delay

2. **Viewer Portal**: Docker build failed due to missing configuration
   - Can be fixed by updating Dockerfile
   - Not critical for core functionality

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for ALB health checks to complete
2. **Test the URLs** in your browser
3. **Monitor ECS services** in AWS Console
4. **Check CloudWatch logs** if any issues occur
